# E2 - Dodge-Em

A small simulation with a custom cursor(crosshair, named "Usercursor.png"),
custom sprite (blue diamond, named "Blueuser.png"), and an old sprite assets
I made for a game in college (dark skull, named "SkullEnemy.gif").
User has acceleration, controlled via mouseX and mouseY.
Adjusted the static effects (color and number).
Skulls could grow (away), and shrink (closer).
**Although it should've grown and shrunk the other ways around
(closer and away, not away and closer). But it gave me an idea for the first
project.
I think it'll be some flight simulation, or something (with idea of gliding
past obstacles, etc.)
